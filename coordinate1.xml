      <p>Prior to the advent of Islam some of the pagan Arabs used to practice the jahiliyyah act of burying their daughters alive, believing them to be a sign of disgrace. They are said to have been buried in the Al-Shabeka Graveyard. It’s also reported that Sumayyah (رضي الله عنها) is buried here. She was the first person to be martyred in the cause of Islam.</p>
      <p>Zayd Ibn Amr ibn Nufail was a hanif who passed away before nubuwat of Rasulullah but had met Rasulullah earlier. He would go there trying to prevent these girls from being buried alive. He is said to have saved hundreds of girls</p>

      <p>Referred to as "al-Muhassab,” the area derives its name from the accumulation of stones carried down by water from neighbouring mountains. The name "al-Abtah” signifies a wide area after a valley. It is also named "Khayf Bani Kinanah”, named after one of the tribes that participated in the boycott against Banu Hashim, the Prophet Muhammad’s ﷺ tribe. Today, the area is known as "al-Ma’abdah”.</p>
      <p>During the Farewell Hajj on the 13th of Dhul Hijjah, after leaving Mina, the Prophet ﷺ stayed at Wadi al-Muhassab. It was the same place in which he encamped between the 4th and 8th of Dhul Hijjah, after having completed his Umrah.</p>
      <p>It was also the practice of some of the companions including Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali and Abdullah ibn Umar M to alight in al-Muhassab after departing from Mina, where they would observe the prayers and rest for a period of time, as the Prophet ﷺ had done</p>

      <p><strong>Masjid al-Rayah</strong> (Arabic: مسجد الراية), also known as <strong>Masjid al-Jowdariyyah</strong> (Arabic: مسجد الجودرية), marked the site where the Prophet ﷺ erected a banner during the Conquest of Makkah in Ramadan 8 AH (January 630 CE). It was demolished in 2012 (1433 AH) during the northern courtyard expansion of Masjid al-Haram.</p>
      <p>Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam (رضي الله عنه) was entrusted with the Muslim banner and instructed to plant it at al-Hajun, the upper part of Makkah. Historians such as al-Tabari and al-Azraqi describe it as a mosque near the well of Jubayr ibn Mut‘im, where the Prophet ﷺ prayed. Symbolically, banners in battle represented morale and resilience, and the role of the standard-bearer carried great weight.</p>
      <p>The masjid was first built by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Abbas and later reconstructed by the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta’sim (640 AH / 1242 CE), Emir Qutlabak (801 AH / 1398 CE), and Sultan Mehmed III (1000 AH / 1591 CE). Modern renovations took place in 1379 AH (1959 CE) and 1394 AH (1974 CE), after which it was renamed King Fahd Mosque before demolition in 2012.</p>
      <p>The Jowdariyyah neighbourhood and the historic well of Jubayr ibn Mut‘im, originally dug by Qusayy bin Kilab, were also removed during the expansion, marking the disappearance of one of Makkah’s oldest neighbourhoods.</p>

      <p>Upon arrival, Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) entered first to clear the cave and block holes with cloth. The Prophet ﷺ slept on his lap, and when Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) was stung, he endured the pain silently until the Prophet ﷺ healed it with his spittle.</p>
      <p>They remained hidden while Abu Bakr’s (رضي الله عنه) son Abdullah brought news each night, and Amir bin Fuhayra (رضي الله عنه) grazed goats nearby to provide milk and cover tracks. Allah (ﷻ) sent a spider to weave a web and doves to nest at the entrance, deterring the Quraysh search party.</p>
      <p>The Prophet ﷺ reassured Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه): "How can you fear for two when the third is Allah?” [Qur'an 9:40]. After three days, Asma (رضي الله عنها) brought provisions, tying them with her torn waistband, earning the title "She of the two waistband.” They then departed towards Madinah.</p>
